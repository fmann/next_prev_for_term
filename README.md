next_prev_for_term
=======================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A Drupal 7 module that creates next and previous links within a vocabulary.  Based on code cribbed from [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org/node/45050#comment-5056854).  I just added a few more options, like including the title or just the words "Next" and "Previous", and a little admin screen.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Drupal 7.x


INSTALLING
----------
1. To install the module copy the 'next_prev_for_term' folder to your sites/all/modules directory.
