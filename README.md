next_prev_for_term
=======================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A Drupal 7 module that creates next and previous links within a vocabulary.  Based on code cribbed from [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org/node/45050#comment-5056854).  I just added a few more options, like including the title or just the words "Next" and "Previous", and a little admin screen.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Drupal 7.x


INSTALLING
----------
1. To install the module copy the 'next_prev_for_term' folder to your sites/all/modules directory.
2. Read more about installing modules at http://drupal.org/node/70151


CONFIGURING AND USING
---------------------
1. Grant "Administer next/previous links" permission to one of your roles.
2. Go to admin/config/content/nextprev 
3. Set the options the way you want them.
4. Enjoy!
